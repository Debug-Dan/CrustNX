# CrustNS
CrustNS is an optimized CFW Package for the Nintendo Switch. It contains more than just the basics but leaves out junk! CrustNS is most optimized for users who want to use EmuNAND to keep their SysNAND safe and secure, but it still works amazingly for everyone else! CrustNS also contains a full guide on how to setup the included software.
